# 📔 Carney Brown Bag Sessions

> _At Carney, we believe that knowledge shared is knowledge multiplied. Our Brown Bag Sessions embody our commitment to continuous learning, collaboration, and innovation._

## 🎯 What are Brown Bag Sessions?

Brown Bag Sessions are informal, lunchtime presentations where team members share knowledge, insights, and experiences with their colleagues. The name comes from the tradition of bringing your lunch in a brown paper bag to these educational gatherings.

These sessions are designed to:

- 🧠 **Foster Knowledge Sharing**: Spread expertise across teams and departments
- 🚀 **Encourage Innovation**: Expose the team to new technologies, methodologies, and perspectives
- 🤝 **Build Community**: Create opportunities for cross-team collaboration and networking
- 📈 **Promote Growth**: Support professional development in a low-pressure environment
- 💡 **Democratize Learning**: Everyone can be both a teacher and a student

## 📚 Repository Structure

Our Brown Bag Sessions are organized in a simple, scalable format:

```
sessions/
├── 01/          # First session: Improving Developer Experience
│   └── index.html
├── 02/          # Second session: (Coming soon)
│   └── index.html
└── ...
```

Each session lives in its own numbered folder under `/sessions/`, making it easy to browse chronologically and maintain a clear history of our learning journey.

## 🎨 Presentation Format

We use [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) for creating beautiful, interactive presentations that work seamlessly in the browser. This choice reflects our commitment to:

- **Accessibility**: Presentations viewable on any device with a web browser
- **Interactivity**: Support for live coding, animations, and dynamic content
- **Version Control**: Presentations stored as code, enabling collaboration through Git
- **Consistency**: Unified look and feel across all sessions
